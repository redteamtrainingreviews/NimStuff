# Nim Stuff
Various Nim Script(s) I have written (or ChatGPT has written) for use in various training classes/CTFs


### service.nim

Created for the course "Hack Smarter's Sliver C2: Pentesting and Evasion".  This will create a service executable, instead of a regular executable that the service control manager will tear down shortly after a service is started, and keep the session stable.

NOTE: This is just the service code.  You will need to take the code from the class and merge it into this code.
